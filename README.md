   - Chain ID: `1115`
   - Currency Symbol: `tCORE`
   - Block Explorer URL: `https://scan.test.btcs.network`
5. Click "Save" to add the network.

### 4. Getting Testnet Tokens

1. Make sure you've selected the "Core Testnet" network in Metamask.
2. Copy your wallet address (you can do this by clicking on your account name in Metamask).
3. Go to the [Core Testnet Faucet](https://scan.test.btcs.network/faucet).
4. Paste your wallet address into the faucet website.
5. Complete any captcha or verification steps if required.
6. Click the "Get tCORE" button to receive testnet tokens.
7. Wait a few moments, and you should see the testnet tokens in your Metamask wallet.

Remember, these are testnet tokens with no real value. They're only for testing and development purposes on the Core testnet.

Now you're all set up with Metamask and connected to the Core testnet with some test tokens to use!
 
 ## Setting up the Project

### 1. Fork the Repository

1. Open your web browser and go to <a href="https://github.com/coredao-org/Build-On-Core.git" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/coredao-org/Build-On-Core.git</a>
2. In the top-right corner of the page, click the "Fork" button.
3. If prompted, select where you want to create the fork (your personal account or an organization).
4. Wait for the forking process to complete. You'll be redirected to your forked repository.

### 2. Clone the Forked Repository

1. Open a terminal on your local machine.
2. Create a new directory for the project and navigate into it:
   ```
   mkdir core-project
   cd core-project
   ```
3. Clone your forked repository (replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username):
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Build-On-Core.git
   ```
4. Navigate into the cloned repository:
   ```
   cd Build-On-Core
   ```

### 3. Navigate to the Specific Folder

Navigate to the Shobhit University folder within the cloned repository:
```
cd University-Dev-Tours/India/Shobhit-University
```

### 4. Clone the Workshop Repository

While inside the Shobhit University folder, clone the Core Workshop repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/b0ney-1/Core-Workshop-C5.git
```

Now you have both repositories set up on your local machine. The Core Workshop repository is nested within the Build-On-Core repository, specifically in the Shobhit University folder.

Your project structure should look like this:
```
core-project/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Build-On-Core/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ University-Dev-Tours/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ India/
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Shobhit-University/
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Core-Workshop-C5/
```

You're now ready to start working on the project!

## Configuring the Project

After setting up the project, you need to configure it with your personal information and install the necessary dependencies. Follow these steps:

### 1. Update the Environment File

1. Navigate to the Core-Workshop-C5 folder.

2. Locate the `.env` file in this directory.

3. Open the `.env` file with your preferred text editor.

4. Find the line that starts with `PRIVATE_KEY=`.

5. Replace the existing private key with your own Metamask wallet's private key. To get your private key from Metamask:
   - Open Metamask and click on the three dots next to your account name
   - Select "Account details"
   - Click on "Export Private Key"
   - Enter your password and copy the displayed private key

6. Save and close the `.env` file.

   **IMPORTANT**: Never share your private key with anyone or commit it to a public repository. The `.env` file should be listed in your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being tracked by git.

### 2. Install Dependencies and Compile Contracts

1. Ensure you're in the Core-Workshop-C5 directory in your terminal.

2. Install the project dependencies by running:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   This command will install all the necessary packages defined in the `package.json` file.

3. After the installation is complete, compile the smart contracts by running:
   ```
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
   This command will compile all the Solidity contracts in your project.

If both commands execute successfully, you should see confirmation messages in your terminal. The `npm install` command will show a list of installed packages, and `npx hardhat compile` will indicate that the compilation was successful.

You have now successfully configured your project and are ready to move on to the next steps!

## Project Deployment

To deploy your project to the Core testnet, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you're in the Core-Workshop-C5 directory in your terminal.

2. Run the following command to deploy your project:
   ```
   npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/deploy.js --network core_testnet
   ```

3. Wait for the deployment process to complete. This may take a few minutes.

4. Once finished, you should see a confirmation message with the deployed contract address. Make sure to save this address as you'll need it for contract verification.

## Contract Verification

After deploying your contract, it's important to verify it on the Core Explorer. This allows others to view and interact with your contract's code. Here's how to do it:

1. Visit the [Core Testnet Explorer](https://scan.test.btcs.network/).

2. In the search bar at the top, paste the contract address you received during deployment.

3. On the contract's page, look for a "Verify and Publish" or similar option. Click on it.

4. You'll be taken to the contract verification page. Here's what you typically need to provide:
   - Contract Address: This should be pre-filled with your contract's address.
   - Compiler Type: Select Solidity(Single File).
   - Compiler Version: Choose the version as `v0.8.24+commit.e11b9ed9`.
   - Select Open source License as MIT License (MIT) and Hit `continue` button 
   - Optimization : Yes.
   - Enter the Solidity Contract Code: Copy and paste your entire Solidity contract code.

5. If your contract uses constructor arguments, you'll need to provide them in ABI-encoded format.

6. If you're using a flattened contract file (combining all imports into one file), make sure to upload this instead of just the main contract file.

7. Double-check all entered information, then click "Verify and Publish".

8. If successful, you'll see a confirmation message, and your contract's page will now show the verified source code.

If you encounter any issues during verification, double-check that the compiler settings match those in your Hardhat configuration, and ensure you're using the correct contract code version that was deployed.

## Create Pull Request

After completing your project, you need to submit your work by creating a pull request. Follow these steps:

1. Manually navigate back to the root directory of the Build-On-Core repository in your file explorer or terminal.

2. Locate the Core-Workshop-C5 directory within the Shobhit-University folder. Manually find and delete the .git folder inside the Core-Workshop-C5 directory. This step is crucial to avoid submodule issues.

   **Note**: The .git folder might be hidden. You may need to enable "Show hidden files" in your file explorer to see it.

3. Open a terminal in the root directory of the Build-On-Core repository and run the following commands:

   Add all changes to git:
   ```
   git add .
   ```

   Commit your changes:
   ```
   git commit -m "Add Core-Workshop-C5 project"
   ```

   Push your changes to your forked repository:
   ```
   git push origin main
   ```

4. Create a Pull Request:
   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub (https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Build-On-Core)
   - Click on the "Contribute" button
   - Click on "Open pull request"
   - You'll be taken to a page titled "Comparing changes"
   - Ensure the base repository is set to `coredao-org/Build-On-Core` and the base branch is `main`
   - Ensure the head repository is set to your fork (`YOUR-USERNAME/Build-On-Core`) and the compare branch is `main`

5. Fill in the Pull Request details:
   - Give your pull request a meaningful title
   - In the description, provide any necessary details about your project
   - If there are any specific instructions or notes for the reviewers, include them here

6. Click on "Create pull request"

Your project is now submitted for review. The Core DAO team will review your pull request and may provide feedback or request changes. Keep an eye on your GitHub notifications for any updates or comments on your pull request.
